* convert csv, format like talbe text 2 table
  
  C-c | Convert the active region to table. If every line contains at least one TAB character,
the function assumes that the material is tab separated. If every line contains a comma,
comma-separated values (CSV) are assumed. If not, lines are split at whitespace 
into fields. You can use a prefix argument to force a specific separator: C-u forces CSV, C-u C-u forces TAB
, and a numeric argument N indicates that at least N consecutive spaces, or alternatively a TAB will be the 
separator. If there is no active region, this command creates an empty Org table.
