* how to activate the ananconda's env python in emacs?
You didn't seem to explain your self much so I'm going to try and guess what you want.
You want to be able to switch conda python versions and conda virtual environments depending on what files you're editing. I recently set this up using the pyvenv package. In my config file I have:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package pyvenv
        :ensure t
        :init
        (setenv "WORKON_HOME" "/home/NAME/anaconda/envs")
        (pyvenv-mode 1)
        (pyvenv-tracking-mode 1))

#+END_SRC

Change the "WORKON_HOME" directory to point to the directory with your virtual environments.
Then in your project directory. Place a file called =.dir-locals.el= in that file place:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
((nil . ((pyvenv-workon . "ENV_NAME"))))
#+END_SRC
where ENV_NAME should be replaced by your virtual-environments name.
Your project tree should look like:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
-Project
  -projectfile_1.py
  -projectfile_2.py
  -.dir-locals.el
#+END_QUOTE
