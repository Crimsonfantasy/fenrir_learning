#+TITLE: Reload
* Nginx config reload without downtime
Run service nginx reload or /etc/init.d/nginx reload
It will do a hot reload of the configuration without downtime.
If you have =pending= requests, then there will be =lingering= nginx processes that will handle those connections before it dies, so it's an extremely graceful way to reload configs.
Sometimes you may want to prepend with sudo
** checking whether existing  pending tcp clients:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo netstat -apn  | grep PEND
#+END_SRC
