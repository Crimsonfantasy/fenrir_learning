* show file modify
#+BEGIN_SRC 
state $fileName
#+END_SRC
stat tells you various information about the file including the last modified date.
At first, I was confused with Modify and Change, just to clarify, stat output lists:
Access shows the time of last data access (e.g. read).
Modify shows the time of last data modification.
Change shows the time the file status last changed.
