  : ShedLock does one and only one thing.
  : It makes sure your scheduled tasks are executed at most once at the same time.
  : If a task is being executed on one node, it acquires a lock which prevents execution of
  : the same task from another node (or thread). Please note, that if one task is already being executed 
  : on one node, execution on other nodes does not wait, it is simply skipped.
